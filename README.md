    - Allowing users to run multiple projects with different dependencies on one machine.  
    - It allows your program to run anywhere (insid e a docker container)  
    - It saves your teammates time and they won't need to spend days on configuring their local development environment.
    - Docker isloate your environment out so that you will never worry about messing some parts of your local machine. (for example, mess your python on your mac.)
    - **In short, docker helps you consistently build, run and ship application.**
